            "para": "My name is Yonela Mangele and I am currently 20 years old. I am an aspiring fullstack web developer and it is all because of my unwavering dedication and love for coding. Ever since I started coding in high school, I have always challenged myself with requiring more assignments from my lecturer so that I could hone my coding skills and also learn how to handle multiple tasks at once on a daily basis, which is a skillset I am currently mastering. When I have a group project, I enjoy leading the group because I have a creative approach to solving a problem. My sense of humour also helps to lighten the mood of my group members and when they are in a fun space to work in, they become motivated to meet the deadlines of projects we work on because as much as I tease around to create a healthy environment, I take my work seriously.",

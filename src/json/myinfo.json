            "para": "My name is Yonela Mangele and I am an aspiring fullstack web developer. Ever since I started coding in 2020, I have always challenged myself with requiring more assignments from my lecturers so that I could hone my skills and also learn how to handle multiple tasks at once on a daily basis, which is a skillset I am currently mastering. I also try by all means to keep up with updates in the tech world so that I can be steps ahead of anything that comes my way.",
